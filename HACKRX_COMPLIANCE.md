## ðŸ§ª **TESTING AND VALIDATION**

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Test HackRX endpoint compliance
curl http://localhost:3001/api/test-hackrx

# Test with custom document
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test-hackrx \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"testUrl": "https://your-document-url.pdf"}'

# Test main HackRX endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/hackrx/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer f52031c67a78585014ed3ea516573de21ad4a25e79074c2be81d7632f31b24ce" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documents": "https://example.com/policy.pdf",
    "questions": ["What is covered?", "What are exclusions?"]
  }'
```
